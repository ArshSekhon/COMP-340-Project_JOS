# COMP-340 Final Project
## Project Readme:

This project covers implementations for Lab1 and Lab2 for MIT's JOS: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/jos.git

#### Tools Required
For now we will need following tools:
1. **QEMU:** It is an open source virtual machine monitor. We will be using this to run JOS.
2. **Compiler Toolchain:** We would also need compiler toolchain. A compiler toolchain consists of various different programs including C compiler, assemblers and linker. We need it to convert the code written in assembly and C to machine language.

#### Check if you have tools installed:
1. Execute ``objdump -i`` and the second line should include ``elf32-i386``.
2. Try executing ``gcc -v`` and it should run successfully.

#### Installing Required tools:
If the commands above do not give the desired output then you can install them using following commands:

**Linux:**

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gdb
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
```

**Mac OS X:**
Note: You need to have homebrew installed for this to work.
```
xcode-select --install
brew install $(brew deps qemu)
PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin make install
```

## Progress Logs:
**IMPORTANT:** This is a log file rather than readme that tracks the weekly process 
### Week 1
#### This project will be based on:
MITâ€™s JOS: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/jos.git

#### Documentation and Resources I plan on using:
1. Assembly for x86: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/
2. PC Assembly: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/pcasm-book.pdf
3. QEMU Docs: https://wiki.qemu.org/Qemu-doc.html
4. C Help: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/
5. Guide for setting up and running: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/labguide.html
6. Other Tools: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/tools.html
7. OS Dev: https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page

#### My Plan
I am planning to start off by learning more about the bootloader. I have already started working on
this part by reading about bootloader on the OS Dev and other sites on the internet. After that, I
plan on learning more about assembly and finishing off the first part i.e. getting OS to boot on
QEMU.
After that, I would start learning C and will also explore memory management part a bit more in
depth and would work on the memory management part.


### Week 2

#### Installed Required Tools: Feb 8, 2019 5:00 pm
I installed the required tools to compile run JOS on Ubuntu. For more info refer to the section below:

```

### Writing minimal programs for languages to be used:  Feb 9, 2019 1:00 pm

#### Assembly: NASM
Good knowledge of assembly is required to complete Lab 1 for this project as it focuses on getting the JOS to boot by writing code for boot loader.

##### Assembly: Hello World
This is basic assembly code that just prints "Hello World!" to the screen (See reference: Assembly Tutorial).

**Commands to assemble, link and run this file:**
1. cd into examples folder.
2. Execute ``mkdir bin``
3. Assemble the program by executing ``nasm -f elf helloworld.asm -o ./bin/helloworld.o``
4. Link the object file to create executable execute ``ld -m elf_i386 -s -o helloworld helloworld.o``
5. Execute the executable by running ``./bin/helloworld``

##### Barebone Bootloader

I continue to work on the bootloader code that we wrote in our second class for COMP 340 and have developed this barebone bootloader that just prints hello world on boot.

**Problem Faced:** Understanding the code was bit of a challenge as it was bit different from what we did cover in COMP 256.
**Solution:** OS Dev and Stack Overflow were a great reasource that really helped me understand how boot loader code worked. 

**Commands to create binary and boot the computer off that binary:**
1. cd into examples folder.
2. Execute ``mkdir bin``
3. Assemble the program by executing ``nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o ./bin/bootloader.bin``
4. Fire a VM that uses our bootloader using the following command ``qemu-system-x86_64 ./bin/bootloader.bin``.

#### C Language
Majority of JOS project is written in C. So there is no doubt that C is of great significance for this project.

##### C: Hello World
This is a simple Hello World application. It just prints "Hello World!" to the screen and exits. If we are able to compile and run this project then we can say that our C compiler is up and running.

**Commands to compile and run this project:**
1. cd into examples folder.
2. In order to compile a C file we need to execute ``gcc <fileToCompile.c> -o <outputFile.out>``. For this example program we can execute ``gcc helloworld.c -o ./bin/helloworld.out``
3. After above command executes succesfully we can run our compiled program by just typing in name of the output file i.e. in our case just execute ``./bin/helloworld.out``
